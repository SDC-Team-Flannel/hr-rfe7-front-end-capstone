# Code of Conduct

Team: Hera

### Roles and Responsibilities

- Team Lead: Manny
- Tech: Alex
- Designer: Jinyan
- Support: Daniel

_these roles are not set in stone, subject to change_

### How will you be communicating with each other?

- Any urgent will be handled via chat in the team channel
- Keep all comms (unless sensitive) to the main slack channel
- Expectation is that only slack comms will be responded to in a timely manner.  For example a pull request on github / request for code review can be submitted on github, but should also be followed up with on slack.

### How will the team make decisions?

- Types of Decicions
  - Trivial - individual implementation decision
  - Medium - minor decision that might have downstream impact, or something that might make individual's code inconsistent from the others.
  - Impactful - major decision that impacts the other's branches or code
  - Err on the side of a decision being more serious

- Decision Making
  - Trivial: no message to other group members necessary
  - Medium: quick slack message that gets a reaction from teammamtes before proceeding
  - Impactful: intro the issue on slack and we can either jump into a zoom or discuss at the next standup

### How will the team handle conflict

- For technical disagreements - we can discuss over slack/zoom, ensuring everyone hears all sides of argument.  Disagreement will be settled based on simple majority vote.  Flipping coin in the event of an intractable 2-2 tie.

- Following the settlement of a conflict - the whole team needs to be bought in.  Disagree and commit.

- Other personal conflicts, attempt to handle 1-1, but can escalate to HR staff.

### How will accountability be addressed / measured?

- Expectations
  - People are online and working on the group project during program hours and agreed upon hours during solo week
  - During work hour you respond to slack within 1-2 hours
  - Letting everyone know your schedule if you're going to be OOO
  - Not #lines of code, not output, expectation is based on input
  - Letting other people know if your work is falling off track
  
- Not meeting expectations
  - We bring it up in the group standup and kindly ask to rememdy

### How will DEI be part of the team culture?

- Make sure everyone's input is heard
- At the end of standup having 1-2 minutes where people can share things they didn't get a chance to earlier
- Having standups be an open forum where people can share if they feel like their input isn't being heard
- This is a situation where people can definitely use 1-1s in slack to share a frustration that the pair could bring to standup

### How will respect be shown / given to each team member?

- Don't be dismissive
- Don't be rude
- Everyone is still learning
- No bad ideas brainstorm

### How will the team support each other?

- Group hugs
- Code complete party + bug bash party
- If someone is falling behind, communicate with others and we can jump in and help get back on track
- Explicitly asking "do you need support on something" during standup
- Celebrating and sharing wins during standup
